MariaDB Server 

This package contains a number of .rpm files that together comprise the MariaDB
Server distribution.

The packages included in this archive may vary depending on the OS you're using
and its release version, as different components may require libraries or
functionality available only in newer releases. 

The .rpm files can be installed individually, but there are complex
interdependencies that are difficult to resolve using rpm alone. For that
reason, this package is distributed as a ready-to-use ZYpp archive, so that you
can use zypper to install the packages in it.

In order for the package manager to be able to install these packages, you will
need to place them in a location that the package manager has privileges to
access. You may find that /opt is a good location where you can unpack the
archive and the package manager will be able to read it.

To use the archive with zypper, create a mariadb.repo file in
/etc/zypp/repos.d/ that points to the directory where you've extracted the
files. A helpful script called setup_repository is included in this archive to
do this for you.

You'll need to do this work as root, so that you can write files to these
locations.

cd /opt
tar -xf ~/filename.tar
filename/setup_repository

After the repository is set up, you should install the MariaDB-server package.

yum install -y MariaDB-server
